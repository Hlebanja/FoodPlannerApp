# FoodPlannerApp
Originally a recipe and ingredients manager, this project has been limited to the creation of a RESTful API with JavaScript on Node.js, using EXPRESS and MongoDB. 

It also includes an android app to interact with the aforementioned API. This app utilized Java for the logic and the Volley library for the http requests.

In RESTful_API-FoodPlanner/Backend/tests, there are also some scripts for tests through the usage of POSTMAN.

## Usage
In order to use the app, you first must:
 -run mongoDB;
 -run the server from withing the folder web.
After that, you should be able to interact with the API through the android app (requires Android Studio) or through http://localhost:3000
